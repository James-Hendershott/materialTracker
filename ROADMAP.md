# Roadmap

## Near-term (MVP)
- Navigation with expo-router: Home, Add Material, Detail, Search.
- Capture or pick image for a material.
- Store materials locally in SQLite.
- Color tagging: 
  - Web: extract 3-5 dominant colors via Canvas.
  - Native: manual color select (temporary).
- Search by name and color buckets.

## Next
- Cloud sync (Supabase): auth, storage, and palettes persisted in Postgres.
- Edge function for reliable palette extraction, semantic color naming (e.g., "forest green").
- Import/export data (JSON + images) for backup.
- Basic theming and accessibility pass.

## Later
- Batch capture workflow, barcode/QR for box locations.
- Offline-first conflict resolution when syncing.
- PWA enhancements: install prompt, icons, manifest.

## Bugs/Todos Backlog
- N/A (initial)
